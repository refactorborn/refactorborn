## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Senior Java Developer with extensive experience designing, building, and optimizing scalable backend systems and enterprise-grade applications. With a strong foundation in core Java and a deep understanding of the Spring ecosystem, I focus on developing clean, modular, and high-performance code for production systems.

From monolith refactoring to microservices design, I bring a pragmatic, solution-oriented mindset to complex software challenges and backend infrastructure.
